# üöÄ Repo Eject CLI

> **Early Stage Project** - This is an MVP tool with core functionality implemented. See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for planned features.

A command-line tool that helps developers clean up their GitHub accounts by finding and safely removing old or inactive repositories. Perfect for developers with cluttered GitHub profiles who want to maintain a clean, professional presence.

## ‚ú® Why Use Repo Eject?

- **Declutter your GitHub profile** - Remove old experiments, abandoned projects, and inactive forks
- **Safe by default** - Interactive prompts and dry-run mode prevent accidental deletions
- **Time-saving** - Quickly identify inactive repositories instead of manually browsing through dozens of repos
- **Professional presence** - Keep only your best work visible to potential employers and collaborators

## üéØ Current Features

- ‚úÖ **Repository Analysis** - Automatically scan and list your GitHub repositories
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Selection** - Choose which repositories to delete through a user-friendly CLI
- ‚úÖ **Safe Deletion** - Confirmation prompts and dry-run mode for safety
- ‚úÖ **GitHub API Integration** - Secure authentication with personal access tokens
- ‚úÖ **Colorful Output** - Clear, readable terminal interface

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** with `repo` scope ([How to create one](#github-token-setup))

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally via npm
npm install -g @cosmstack/repoeject

# Or with yarn
yarn global add @cosmstack/repoeject
```

### GitHub Token Setup

1. Go to [GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select the `repo` scope (full control of private repositories)
4. Copy the generated token

### Usage

```bash
# Run the interactive CLI
repoeject

# Dry run (see what would be deleted without actually deleting)
repoeject --dry-run

# Skip confirmation prompts (use with caution!)
repoeject --force

# Show help
repoeject --help
```

The CLI will guide you through:
1. **Authentication** - Enter your GitHub token when prompted
2. **Repository Scanning** - Automatically fetch and analyze your repositories
3. **Selection** - Choose which repositories to delete from an interactive list
4. **Confirmation** - Review and confirm your selections before deletion
